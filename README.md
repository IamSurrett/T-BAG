# T-BAG 
Python text-based adventure game

Welcome to T-BAG!! I created this program from an old homework assignment after reminiscing with a friend about text-based adventure games. 
I ended up creating both a terminal version and a gui version (using the [PySimpleGUI](https://pypi.org/project/PySimpleGUI) library.)

## About T-BAG
This project uses json objects to hold the data about the rooms and the player. It has the ability to save and load games from a folder, and the ability to explore rooms in the game. Users can also carry, drop, and examine objects. Currently there are no user stats, winnable actions, or ways to earn points although I hope to implement all of these in the future.
